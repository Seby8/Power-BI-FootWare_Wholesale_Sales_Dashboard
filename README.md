# Footwear Sales Dashboard

I have a dataset collected from Kaggle, which I used for creating my Power BI dashboard.  
You can find the dataset here: [Footwear Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahlahaji/footware-sales-dataset).  

<br>

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze footwear sales performance using Power BI.  
The dashboard helps in understanding sales trends, identifying top brands, analyzing product mix, and evaluating profitability across different locations.  

<br>

## Visualization Tasks
1. **Sales Trend Analysis:**
   - Line chart showing monthly Total Revenue (â‚¹) trends.  
   - Add a slicer for Brand and Dealer Location to filter trends.  

2. **Top Performing Brands:**
   - Bar chart ranking Brand by Total Revenue and Profit.  
   - Add a tooltip showing Profit Margin %.  

3. **Product Mix Analysis:**
   - Pie or Donut chart showing share of Total Revenue by Product.  
   - Tooltip to show Quantity Sold and Average Unit Price.  

4. **Profitability Heatmap:**
   - Matrix visual with Dealer Location (rows) and Product (columns) showing Net Profit.  
   - Apply color gradient for easy interpretation.
